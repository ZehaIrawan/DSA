# The two-pointer technique is one of the most powerful tools in your problem-solving toolbox, especially for array and string problems.

#ðŸ§  What is the Two Pointer Technique?
#You use two variables (pointers) to iterate over a list â€” either from the start and end, or both from the start â€” to efficiently find answers without checking every possible combination.

#It helps reduce O(nÂ²) brute force to O(n) or O(n log n).

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]

target = 7

#for i in range(len(numbers)):
#  print(numbers[i])


# define first pointer (left)
# define second pointer (right)
# in this sorted array case we define it as index 0 and last index
# use while loop and then move the pointers


# def has_pair_with_sum(numbers,target):
#   left = 0
#   right = len(numbers) - 1

#   while left < right:
#     current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
#     if current_sum == target:
#       return True
#     elif current_sum < target:
#       left += 1
#     else:
#       right -= 1

#   return False

# print(has_pair_with_sum(numbers,target))
